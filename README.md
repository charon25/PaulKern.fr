# paulkern.fr

This repo contains the source code of my [personnel website](https://www.paulkern.fr). It is made entirely in raw PHP and uses Bootstrap for the CSS.

This website is like an "online CV" which summarises all my experiences and personnal projects. Unfortunately it is only in French for now.
